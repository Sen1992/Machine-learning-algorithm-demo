The perceptron is a kind of statistical machine learning algorithm. In a word, we use a straight line or plane to divide input data into two categories. We build linear discriminant model and the numbers of parameters is corresponding to structure of input data. Adopting gradient discent method to minimize loss funtion which is presented by the distance between wrong classified point and line or plane, we can get the optimal meode.
